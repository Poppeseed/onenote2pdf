# onenote2pdf

This is a tool by huuhoa for exporting OneNote documents to PDF (with a table of contents) by script. 

It was hosted on CodePlex, but CodePlex is transitioning to a read-only archive. I use this tool regularly and find it to be very useful, so I migrated the files over here. 

The source is [here](OneNote2PDF_source_29-01-2008/OneNote2PDF), the executable [here](OneNote2PDF_binary_with_iTextSharp_29-01-2008/OneNote2PDF_0.3) and the old docs [here](docs)

Although written for OneNote 2007, I am currently using it with OneNote 365 ProPlus Version 1711 and finding it to work without fault.
